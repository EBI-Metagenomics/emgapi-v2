        **The API for [MGnify](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics), EBIâ€™s platform for the submission, analysis, discovery and comparison of metagenomic-derived datasets.**

        ## Endpoints
        API endpoints (URLs) are available for all data types stored in MGnify.
        In general, there are list endpoints (ending `/`) and detail endpoints (ending `/<accession>`) for individually accessioned data.
        Where a data type is not accessioned, alternative natural identifiers are used (like a short `slug` for Super Studies).
        Commonly used relationships are available as nested list endpoints, like `studies/{accession}/samples` for the samples belonging to a study.

        ## Data format
        The API returns JSON responses.
        List endpoints return data in the format {count: 10, items: [{...}, ...]} (unless specified otherwise)
        Detail endpoints return a single object `{...}`.

        ## Data availability
        Most data are public, available without authentication.
        Private data is available only to authenticated users, and the authentication is based on Webin credentials from ENA.
        To use these, a JWT token must be obtained for the Webin credentials, using the `/auth` endpoints.
