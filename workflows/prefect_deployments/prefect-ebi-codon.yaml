    Get a study from ENA (or MGnify), and run assembly analysis the assemblies of the study.

    This then chains the Assembly Analysis Pipeline, VIRIfy and the Mobilome Annotation Pipeline using
    batches of assemblies to analise.

    It keeps track of the batches and their statuses.

    :param study_accession: e.g. PRJ or ERP accession
    :param workspace_dir: Path for the workspace dir. Defaults to the configured SLURM default workdir.

  description: |-
    Run the assembly analysis pipeline-v6 for a given batch, including ASA, VIRify, and MAP.

    This function orchestrates the execution of the ASA pipeline, VIRify, and MAP. It handles tasks such as generating
    samplesheets, managing pipeline states, and storing relevant metadata into the database for further processing.

    Additionally, it imports analysis download files for each pipeline, validating results, and generates
    the study summary files for the batch.

    The flow is idempotent and can be restarted from any point:
    - ASA: Only processes analyses without asa_status=COMPLETED
    - VIRify: Only processes analyses with asa_status=COMPLETED and virify_status!=COMPLETED
    - MAP: Only processes analyses with virify_status=COMPLETED and map_status!=COMPLETED

    :param assembly_analyses_batch_id: Unique identifier for the assembly analysis batch to process.
    :type assembly_analyses_batch_id: uuid.UUID
    :raises ClusterJobFailedException: If the cluster job fails during the ASA pipeline execution.
    :raises Exception: For any unexpected errors encountered during the pipeline execution.

- name: run_virify_batch_deployment
  description: |-
    Runs the VIRify pipeline for a batch of assemblies.

    It expects the analyses to have been completed by ASA at this point. It will select those
    analyses and uses the ASA end-of-run virify samplesheet to pick up the assemblies to execute.

    The flow is idempotent: analyses that are already COMPLETED for VIRify will be skipped.
    Only analyses with asa_status=COMPLETED and virify_status!=COMPLETED will be processed.

    It doesn't validate the results or import them, but the results will be stored in the batch workspace.

    :param assembly_analyses_batch_id: Unique identifier for the assembly batch to be
        processed by the VIRify pipeline.
    :type assembly_analyses_batch_id: uuid.UUID
    :raises ClusterJobFailedException: If the VIRify pipeline execution job fails.
    :raises Exception: For any unexpected errors during pipeline execution.

  description: |-
    Run the MAP (Mobilome Annotation Pipeline) for a batch of assemblies.

    It expects the analyses to have been completed with ASA and VIRify at this point. It will select those
    analyses and generate a samplesheet for the MAP pipeline.

    The flow is idempotent: analyses that are already COMPLETED for MAP will be skipped.
    Only analyses with virify_status=COMPLETED and map_status!=COMPLETED will be processed.

    It doesn't validate the results or import them, but the results will be stored in the batch workspace.

    This flow won't raise an exception if the MAP pipeline fails unless raise_on_failure is set to True.
    This behavior is useful for batch processing, where we want to continue processing batches even if one fails.

    :param assembly_analyses_batch_id: The AssemblyAnalysisBatch to process

  description: |-
    Run the last study level steps on study assembly analysis batches.
    This method checks that all the study batches have finished running, as in each
    batch 3 flows (aca, virify and map) are not running anymore. This is not ideal, and I'm
    working to improve it.
    TODO: Improve as is_running() is not enough, flows may have failed or haven't even started!
    TODO: Add unit tests
    TODO: Use events or automations to improve this

    This includes:
    - Merging assembly study summaries
    - Adding summaries to downloads
    - Copying v6 study summaries
    - Updating study features
